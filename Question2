<!-- A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same
backward as forward, such as madam or rotator. Using any scripting or programming language that
you wish:
A) Write or source a method that checks to see if a given word provided by a user as input is a
palindrome.
B) What are some possible security concerns with the code that you have written or sourced?
C) Describe a good way and a bad way of fixing one of these security concerns in your submitted
code.
If you are not fluent in any programming language or code, then you may submit your answer as an
algorithm in pseudo-code.
Example:
if "1"
print response
"I am case 1" -->


A) I have the beginnings of a palindrome checker here - https://codesandbox.io/s/vigilant-monad-v533xn 

it console logs the initial string and its reverse, but I never did complete it to fully check for a palindrome.

In psudocode I would do the following:

#take the entered string and break it down to a lowercase array/list of characters

splitString = str.split("");

#reverse the array and join it back together to create a new string

const final = splitString.reverse().join();

#compare the initial string and the final string

 if (final === str) {
      return true;
    }


#B) I'm not sure about 'security' but special characters or spaces would need to be accounted for, this would be easiest done by a regex check and replace them with no character, eg: 

const re = /[^A-Za-z0-9]/g;
    str = str.toLowerCase().replace(re, "");
